🎥Netflix Clone Website🍿

Hosted a netflix cone website using AWS☁️

🚀Step 1: Initial Setup and Deployment ::: Need to setup EC2 and Deploy the clone git to that in the linux machine and with help of API we can pull all the data of the website to our machine. Use docker to create and run the app using container

🔐Step 2 : Security ::: Install SonarQube and Trivy & install Necessary Plugins in Jenkins.

🔁Step 3 : Automation ::: Create a CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins to automate the application deployment

👁️Step 4 : Monitoring : Install Prometheus and Grafana and import dashboards to view the metrics in a graphical interface

🔖It was a great learning experience, made many mistakes along the project, and many had to individually debug many errors. Make small changes in CI/CD Pipelines many times.
